in the main game menu you have the craft items button.
in the crafting menu you have lists of items you can craft.
potions are available only after you get the alchemy upgrade.
each item has resources you need to have and tools needed to create it.
for example: to create fiber you need 2 twigs and a stone handaxe.
after "you need" are the items that will be reduced after you craft the item.
after "requires" are the item you need to own to craft the item, they dont get reduced
when you craft the item.
bronze tools are stronger and if they break you have a 50% chance to get back 1 
bronze.
to win the game you will need to craft a longboat.
|||you need a stone hammer and a forg to craft bronze tools|||
and dont forget that tools may break when used (for gathering/fighting).
