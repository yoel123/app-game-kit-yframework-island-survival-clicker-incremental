potions are the fast lane, a few speed and crafting potions can win you the game.
to craft potions you need three things. buy the alchemy upgrade, craft a glass vial,
and have the rare ingredients (there is a low chance to find them when you collect
resources).
to use a potion go to collect resources, and if you have the alchemy upgrade you will have a
button called potions.
in the potions screen use one potion at a time. speed potion will double the resourses you 
collect for its duration, streangth potion will double your attack power when you fight zombies,
fire skin wont let any zombies touch you as you have a fire aura, the crafting potion will double the
items you craft, mineral sight will help you mine ores better.
on the beach you can find pike and power seed, sell the sand you dont need for points.
